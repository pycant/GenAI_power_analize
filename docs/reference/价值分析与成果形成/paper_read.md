## The role of artificial intelligence in the supply chain finance innovation process

### Abstract
Leveraging on ten case studies, the paper examines the Supply Chain Finance (SCF) innovation process through a multiple stakeholder perspective (buyers, suppliers, and SCF providers). The aim is to identify the phases of the process impacted by Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as its benefits and challenges. AI affects several activities in the Initiation phase of the innovation process, supporting the SCF provider’s commercial activities and contributing to assessing the buyer’s creditworthiness, detecting fraud, or proposing the right SCF solution. In the Implementation phase, AI supports assessing the supplier’s credit rating, categorizing and onboarding suppliers, and fastening the administrative tasks. Formulating 9 propositions, this study supports the theory related to the SCF by providing empirical evidence about the role of AI in the SCF innovation process and also identifying the resulting benefits and challenges for all the actors involved.
